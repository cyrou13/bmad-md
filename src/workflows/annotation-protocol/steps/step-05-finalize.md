```

### 5.2 Pilot Test

Before full-scale annotation:

**Pilot Parameters:**
- Sample size: 50-100 cases
- Annotators: 2-3 certified annotators
- Duration: 1-2 weeks

**Pilot Objectives:**
- [ ] Validate guidelines clarity
- [ ] Measure actual IAA
- [ ] Identify guideline gaps
- [ ] Estimate annotation throughput
- [ ] Test quality control processes

**Pilot Success Criteria:**
- IAA meets threshold
- < 5% cases require guideline clarification
- Annotators report guidelines are clear
- No systematic errors identified

### 5.3 Refine Based on Pilot

Document and address:
- Guideline ambiguities identified
- Edge cases not covered
- Tool/workflow issues
- Training gaps

Update protocol version after refinements.

### 5.4 Approval Gate

**Required Approvals:**

| Approver | Focus | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Dr. Claire | Clinical validity of definitions | [ ] |
| Dr. Gauss | Statistical adequacy of QC plan | [ ] |
| Dr. Régis | Regulatory compliance | [ ] |
| Project Lead | Resource and timeline | [ ] |

### 5.5 Launch Readiness

Confirm before launching:
- [ ] All annotators certified
- [ ] Tools tested and accessible
- [ ] Guidelines finalized and distributed
- [ ] QC monitoring in place
- [ ] Escalation paths defined

## Outputs

- [ ] Annotation Protocol Document finalized
- [ ] Pilot completed and passed
- [ ] Approvals obtained
- [ ] Ready for production annotation

## Workflow Complete

Annotation Protocol is ready. Proceed to:
- Execute annotation campaign
- Monitor quality continuously
- Feed into Bias Assessment workflow

## Regulatory Traceability

This protocol fulfills:
- FDA: Reference standard documentation
- EU AI Act: Labeling methodology (Article 10)
- GMLP: Appropriate reference standard
- ISO 13485: Design input documentation
